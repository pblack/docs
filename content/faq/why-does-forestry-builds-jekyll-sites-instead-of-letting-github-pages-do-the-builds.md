title: Why does Forestry builds Jekyll sites instead of letting GitHub Pages do the
  builds?
draft: true

Forestry will build your Jekyll site before deploying to GitHub Pages. The reason for doing this is that GitHub Pages only has support for a small number of plugins, whereas Forestry allows it’s users to leverage any plugin they would like to use with their Jekyll site.
