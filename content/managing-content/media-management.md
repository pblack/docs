Forestry has a fully-featured media manager for managing all of the static assets of your site, such as images, PDFs, text files, videos, and more. You can find it under *"site"* in the sidebar of your CMS, as `Media`.

## Managing Your Media
Forestry allows you to do the following with your media:
* Upload new media by clicking "+" or dragging them in
* Delete existing media

## Adding Media to Content
The media manager is also available in the content editor and in data files provided you’ve setup an image upload field, file upload field, or gallery field.

When using these fields, a user is given the option to select an existing piece of media, or upload a new piece of media to use in this field.
