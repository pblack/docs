Forestry’s billing works on a per-site basis. This means that your *plan* applies to the site you added it to.

For information on our plans, see our [plans page][1].

## How Sites Work
For each user, there are two types of sites:

- **Owned Sites:** sites that you are the **Site Owner** of.
- **Collaborative Sites:** sites that you’ve been invited to collaborate on.

## How Trials Work
Every account is entitled to 14 free trial days on any plan of their choosing.

The trial days can be applied to any site *owned* by that account. Only one site may be on a trial at a time.

## How Per-Site Billing Works
Billing is configured on a per-site basis, and billing can be managed by *any user of that site*.

A user becomes the *billing user* when they change the site’s plan.

The payment information used to handle the plan billing is the payment information configured in the *billing user’s* account information.
