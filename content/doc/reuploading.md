If you're not using GitHub with forestry, and you need to re-upload your project, you can upload your project files only, or you can upload content and project files.  

Choosing project files only will overwrite things like:  

* Config file
* Layouts files
* Static Assets
* Etc

If you choose to update project files AND content files, you will also overwrite:

* Content files, such as posts and pages 
* Data files

Finally, if you want to update your local copy of your site, see [downloading a backup](https://forestry.io/docs/downloading-a-backup-of-your-site/).
