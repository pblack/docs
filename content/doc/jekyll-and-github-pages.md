Forestry can do 2 things when you save your content updates. 

1. Compile your site and deploy it to your host  
2. Commit your changes to your repo

If you use GitHub pages to compile your site for you, you might just want Forestry to commit your updates back to your repo.  In order to do this, select **commit to source repo only** from the Hosting setup window.

If, instead, you want Forestry to compile your site and deploy it to a repo, you'll need to set up two different repos. One with your Jekyll source code and one for your compiled site.
