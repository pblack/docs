In Forestry, users are managed on a per-site basis. On free plans, you can only have 1 user.

If you are on a paid plan, you can invite additional users to your site. This can be done from your [Sites Dashboard][1].

From the dropdown menu (…) of a site, select `Manage Team`.

In the modal that opens, you can manage existing users, including:

* Changing the email associated with the user
* Changing the permission/role of the user
* Remove the user from the site

You can also add new team members from this view.

## Permission Roles
In Forestry, users can be given one of four roles. These affect what the user can do inside the CMS.

1. **The Owner** is the primary account holder for that site. They can:
	1. Edit and publish content
	2. Manage other users
	3. Can manage the site settings
	4. Can delete the site (this is irreversible)
2. **Developers** are the second highest permission for a site. They can:
	1. Edit and publish content
	2. Manage other users
	3. Can manage the site settings  
3. **Site owners** are the managers of a site. They can:
	1. Edit and publish content
	2. Manage other users
3. **Content Editors** are the writers for the site. They can only:
	1. Edit and publish content
