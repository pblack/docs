Forestry allows users to white-label their custom CMS by uploading their own logo in the site settings. This is great for freelancers or businesses that want to provide their customers with a powerful CMS for their Static Site while maintaining their own business branding.

## White-label Standards
In order to get the best results from your white-labelling, there are some standards you should follow to ensure the CMS looks the best it can.

**Logo Standards**
* Upload a logo with a transparent background, with bright colors. Preferably white.
* Upload a logo with the dimensions of 300 wide x 57 high.

## Uploading a Logo
To add your own logo to your CMS, you can do the following:

**Go to the "Settings" section of your site’s CMS**

**Find the "Logo" option for your site**

**Drag & drop your logo image onto the drop zone or click to select a file to upload**

**Save your site settings**
