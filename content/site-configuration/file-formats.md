# File formats

On a per site basis, you can configure what format new content created in Forestry should be created in.

Currently these are:

* Markdown
* HTML

## Markdown

Setting your file format to markdown means that any content created in Forestry will be turned into an `.md` file, and the content body for that piece of content will be output in markdown format.

## HTML

Setting your file format to markdown means that any content created in Forestry will be turned into an `.html` file, and the content body for that piece of content will be output in HTML format.
