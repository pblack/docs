Static sites are websites built using static, unchanging files. They require no server processing time to deliver the content to the user, which makes them very fast and performant.

Static site generators are the modern way of building static sites. They convert simple, text-based content files in static files ready for the web. 

They’re fantastic for developers because they are extremely fast, are built to work with version-control, and require little-to-no setup compared to existing solutions like Wordpress.

Generally static sites are harder-to-use for less technically inclined users because they provide no interface for editing the text-based content files. They often require a basic skill set in the command line and require you to edit your content with a text editor.

*However,* Forestry solves this issue by providing them with a powerful CMS that they will feel comfortable with.
